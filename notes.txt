to start a git repo locally:
git init

to add files to git:
git add . 

to commit files:
git commit -m "put a title here
>
> put a message here"

NB: you can press enter when the speech quotes are open and it will add line breaks..

to sort with github, create a new repo on github.. follow instructions there, something like:
git remote add origin https://github.com/examplesproject/01-travis-ci-test.git
git push -u origin master

i set the wrong location for git, as i want to use ssh and not https.. to change use:
(git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git)
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:examplesproject/01-travis-ci-test.git

(from: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14762034/push-to-github-without-password-using-ssh-key)

you cannot use the same ssh key on a github account, as one you already use elsewhere!
create a new key using

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "examplesproject-github, created 05nov2013"

where flags.. -t is for type, -b is for bytes and -C is for comment
location is V:\personal\web\keys

just making a change..
